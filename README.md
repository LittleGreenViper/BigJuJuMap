# ``BigJuJuMap``

A Self-Contained Map With Multiple, Aggregated, Custom Markers

## Overview

This package was specifically designed to offer SwiftUI apps the opportunity to have a much more involved map experience than that provided by default.

It also allows a "drop in" high-functionality map for UIKit projects.

## How Does It Work?

The implementation is provided as a dynamic-linked [framework](), that instantiates a single [UIViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIViewController) instance.
